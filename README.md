## Week 1:
  * Discrete Mathematics deals with mathematical proofs
  * Proof - chain of logical deduction leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms
    - Statement is either true or false
    - Mathematical reasoning
  * We learned about 
    - Truth Tables
    - Propositions:
      - inverse of p→q which is ¬p → ¬q
      - converse of p→q which is q → p
      - contrapositive of p→q which is ¬q → ¬p
    - Logical Connectives:
      - (¬) Negation
      - (∧) Conjunction
      - (∨) Disjunction
      - (⊕) Exclusive Disjunction
      - (→) Implication
      - (↔) Biconditional
  * Math Expression:
    - ¬p = val(¬p) = 1-val(*p)
    - ∧ = val(p∧q) = min(val(p),val(q))
    - ∨ = val(p∨q) = max(val(p),val(q))
